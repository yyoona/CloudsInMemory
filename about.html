                Numerous events occur and disappear in the sky without our awareness. These events are primarily
                perceived through clouds, sunlight, and atmospheric elements. Changes in the sky that directly touch the
                Earth's surface, like rainfall, are easily recognized by us. However, it is difficult to perceive the
                moments of the existence of clouds and optical phenomena, as they silently appear and disappear.
                Therefore, the fluid and transient clouds and optical phenomena in the sky can only be remembered when
                we look up at the sky. Depending on the clouds and phenomena that come into our view at that moment, the
                image of the sky is remembered as a selective visual fragment.

                Particularly, the shape of the clouds in our memories might be as vague as the cloud's own fluid nature.
                Then, is there any way to examine and sense our memories of clouds more minutely?

                This project base the author's exploration on personal and subjective observations to communicate
                sensibly with the entities known as clouds in the sky. Firstly, the author preserves her memories of the
                clouds through photographs. Photographs incorporate human concepts of motility and dynamics such as the
                location, direction, time, and how the focus is set. Thus, the act of capturing the shape of clouds
                through photos is simple, but it involves various motility, spatiality, and subjectivity in sensual
                communication with the surrounding entities. This act of taking photos generates and recalls memories of
                clouds, providing a method to examine these memories in more detail.
